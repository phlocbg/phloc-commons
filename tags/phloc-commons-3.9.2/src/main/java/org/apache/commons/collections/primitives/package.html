      <p>
         Collections of primitive values. 
         Generally these extensions offer memory 
         and performance improvements over the 
         <code>Object</code> wrapped alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 The package provides versions of 
      	 the major collections framework interfaces
      	 (<code>Collection</code>, <code>List</code>, 
      	 <code>Map</code>, <code>Set</code>, etc.) and their 
      	 helpers (<code>Iterator</code>, <code>ListIterator</code>, 
      	 etc) for each primitive type, and various concrete 
      	 implementations of these.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 Also see {@link org.apache.commons.collections.primitives.adapters}.
