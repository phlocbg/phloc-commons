<h1>Idea og <em>phloc-settings</em></h1>
<p>There are 3 different elements within this project. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configuration</li>
  <li>Preferences</li>
  <li>Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>These different types are outlined as follows:</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>A configuration is a <em>read-only</em> set of application properties. They are provided from the outside (e.g.
from a system administrator) and cannot be changed while the application is running.</p>
<p>If one or more configuration elements should be overrideable with user settings <em>preferences</em> are the way to do it.</p>
