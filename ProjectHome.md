Provides common functionality missing in the Java runtime library, increases the productivity of using the basic Java components etc. Covers collections, IO, message digesting, standard algorithms, trees, etc. See the ChangeLog for details. Maven usage guide can be found in FirstSteps. By default phloc-commons is designed for Java 1.6+ but a special Java 1.5 version has been added since v4.0.7.

Since Version 4.2.0 no more downloads can be made available on Google Code. Therefore the JDK 1.6 versions can be found at http://repo.phloc.com/maven2/com/phloc/phloc-commons/ and the JDK 1.5 versions can be found at http://repo.phloc.com/maven2/com/phloc/phloc-commons-jdk5/ Since version 4.3.3 phloc-commons can be found on Maven Central.
